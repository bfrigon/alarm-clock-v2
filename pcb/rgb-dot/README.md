To use this project template : 

* Rename kicad.pro_template to kicad.pro

* Open kicad.pro and change the line "LibDir" to where the libraries are located. If you wish to use the default kicad libraries, remove this line and also the [eeschema/libraries] section.

* Add a symbolic link in /usr/share/kicad/template pointing to this folder.

The meta directory contains informations about the template. Edit the info.html file to change the title and description.

The worksheet.kicad_wks file is my custom page layout. You can modify it with plEditor.
